You are playing the FairInsurancePricing game, a game designed to show the importance of fairness in setting insurance prices. 
In this game you are the product manager of a new car insurance product. Car insurance is an important product for many people: you cannot own  a car without insurance. The insurance cost can range from 20 euro to 400 euros per month so it is significant part of the car cost. Many people need a car for their job. Insurance is a competitive market, with multiple companies offering insurance. 
You are the product manager for a new insurance product CarX. As the product manager, you lead a small team consisting of insurance and marketing specialists. Together you much make decisions about the product name, the required information for purchasing the insurance, the pricing strategy (who pays how much premium based on the information given, such as information about the main driver, the location of the car, car features or other information you want to consider).
When making these decisions, you must take the following onto account: applicable legislation (e.g. privacy regulation, anti-discrimination regulation and consumer protection rules) but also the public image of the insurance firm you work for, and the overall profitability of your insurance firm and their shareholders. 

You will have to answer several multiple choice questions, based on fairness strategies. Each answer will have impact on three aspects of the product: Profitability, Fairness and Compliance
Game challenge 1:
Your goal is to get the highest possible profitability score. However, your Fairness and Compliance should be high enough. If you have insufficient fairness or complaince, your product is rejects and your profitability is zero. 

Game challenge 2:
You can play the again, but this time you want to optimize for the average of profitability and fairness
